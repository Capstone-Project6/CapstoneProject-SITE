## Problem Statement and Description

Currently, there are a handful of popular event-searching websites and applications on the market. However, the most well-known sites, such as Eventbrite and Ticketmaster, do not currently make it easy for users to find events tailored to their interests or for users to easily find events based on certain criteria (price, location, etc). 

Our first goal is creating an event-searching site that has a great user-interface and one that is easy-to-use. Rather than being presented with a cluttered site of seemingly random events, we would like for our users to easily be able to view searched events in an organized way. This would be done by providing specific filters that a user can choose from. Also, a logged-in userâ€™s feed would feature events relevant to their interests that would be specified during registration. For example, an art-lover might be shown classes, meetups, or social events related to their passion on the home page.

Our second goal is for users of our site to be fully informed, so that they can feel comfortable attending an event that they find. We will achieve this goal by implementing a rating and review system for every event and every organizer featured on our website. This way, a user can determine if an organizer seems trustworthy.
