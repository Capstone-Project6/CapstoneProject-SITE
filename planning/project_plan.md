## Problem Statement and Description

Currently, there are a handful of popular event-searching websites and applications on the market. However, the most well-known sites, such as Eventbrite and Ticketmaster, do not currently make it easy for users to find events tailored to their interests or for users to easily find events based on certain criteria (price, location, etc). 

Our first goal is creating an event-searching site that has a great user-interface and one that is easy-to-use. Rather than being presented with a cluttered site of seemingly random events, we would like for our users to easily be able to view searched events in an organized way. This would be done by providing specific filters that a user can choose from. Also, a logged-in userâ€™s feed would feature events relevant to their interests that would be specified during registration. For example, an art-lover might be shown classes, meetups, or social events related to their passion on the home page.

Our second goal is for users of our site to be fully informed, so that they can feel comfortable attending an event that they find. We will achieve this goal by implementing a rating and review system for every event and every organizer featured on our website. This way, a user can determine if an organizer seems trustworthy.


## User Roles and Personas

User Roles

1.Eventgoers
2.Event Organizers

Eventgoers

Sydney is an eventgoer from Atlanta, Georgia that enjoys going to concerts from huge, well known artists to hidden ones. She enjoys going out on the weekends with friends by looking for something to do such as events. She has a full time internship and a limited budget that she can't look for events for a long time and she does not want to spend too much. She is to use the event finder app to look for a concert of any type near her area with specific filters of concerts that cost a certain amount that fits her budget.

Abbey is a 30 year old computer science professional that wants to expand his professional network and learn different coding languages. He wants to keep up with the newer technology to stay competitive with his peers. He will use the app to search for computer science talks, workshops, or webinars to learn the new skills and connect with fellow peers interested in that area. He would be able to filter on which organizers are the best for hosting these type of events.

Event Organizers

Sharon enjoys partying and meeting new people frequently to develop friendships of all kinds. She noticed that there are not much events around her area to meet with people. So, she decides to use the app to create an event to party and bring people from her area together. She also wants to let guests know that the event is free to join and to rate her as a great organizer to develop a reputation as a trustworthy organizer.

Jake's mother passed away from breast cancer. To honor her, he wants to host a walkathon to fundraise money for research towards breat cancer as well as raising awareness to his community. He doesn't know too many people that have dealt with this situation so he creates an event for his county to reach out and connect with those who went through it.
