# Project Proposal

## Problem Statement

Currently, there are a handful of popular event-searching websites and applications on the market. However, the most well-known sites, such as Eventbrite and Ticketmaster, do not currently make it easy for users to find events tailored to their interests or for users to easily find events based on certain criteria (price, location, etc). 

Our first goal is creating an event-searching site that has a great user-interface and one that is easy-to-use. Rather than being presented with a cluttered site of seemingly random events, we would like for our users to easily be able to view searched events in an organized way. This would be done by providing specific filters that a user can choose from. Also, a logged-in userâ€™s feed would feature events relevant to their interests that would be specified during registration. For example, an art-lover might be shown classes, meetups, or social events related to their passion on the home page.

Our second goal is for users of our site to be fully informed, so that they can feel comfortable attending an event that they find. We will achieve this goal by implementing a rating and review system for every event and every organizer featured on our website. This way, a user can determine if an organizer seems trustworthy.


## Description


The main purpose of this project is to create a platform that makes it easy for users to find events. The key features our site will have to offer will be a feature to organize displayed events based on a user's interests. Another feature would be an easy to use filtering system that allows users to choose events based on price, location, and type of event. In addition to this feature, our site will allow users to see the details about who is organizing events, and will allow them to do further research. 

The target audience will have to create an account, where they can specify their interests, and this data will be used to display events that are relevant and/or similar to a user's interests. In addition to this, our site will recommend future events to users such as sporting events or concerts they may be interested in.


## Expected Features List

- Eventgoer profile
- Event Organizer profile
- Eventgoer and organizer login
- Filter events by type or price
- Display relevant events
- Recommend future events
- Display number of tickets/spots available
- View organizer information
- Rating system for events and organizers
- Reviews about events
- Preferences Form

## Related Work


Two of the most popular websites for finding an event are ticketmaster and eventbrite. Our project aims to standout by combining these two, and making one website for users to choose from a wide variety of events, that do not have strong limitations. One issue with eventbrite is that they currently do not have a great user interface, and this makes it difficult to narrow down their preferences as the feed is not very organized. Ticketmaster often makes it difficult for users to know about the availability of tickets, and so our project will let users know how many seats, tickets, or spots there are. We also want users to know the likelihood they are able to attend an event based on popularity and pricing.

## Open Questions


- How would we go about using more than one API? 
- How would we filter events based on a user's interests?
- How would we encrypt personal information of users?
