# Project Proposal

## Problem Statement

Insert your groups problem statement and target audience.

The problem we want to solve is to create a better user experience for anyone looking for events to attend. The problem with other platforms is that they make it difficult for users to navigate and find events due to the limited filters and poor interface. Currently these other platforms do not make it easy to determine the likelihood that a user would be able to attend an event due to pricing, number of tickets, etc. We also want to structure our feed of events so the organized events are relevant to a user's interests, and not just random events at a given time. We would also provide users with more information about the details around who is organizing the event, particularly for smaller events.

## Description

What is the main purpose of your project? What are the key features your site has to offer its users? How will your targeted audience use your website?

The main purpose of this project is create a platform that makes it easy for users to find events. The key features our site will have to offer will be a feature to organize displayed events based on a user's interests. Another feature would be an easy to use filtering system that allows users to choose events based on price, location, and type of event. In addition to this feature, our site will allow users to see the details about who is organizing events, and will allow them to do further research. The target audience will have to create an account, where they can specify their interests, and this data will be used to display events that are relevant and/or similar to a user's interests. In addition to this, our site will recommend future events to users such as sporting events or concerts they may be interested in.

## Expected Features List

Add a list of your groups's brainstormed features list
- User profile
- User login
- Filter events by type or price
- Display relevant events
- Recommend future events
- Display number of tickets/spots available
- View organizer information
- Rating system for events and organizers
- Reviews/comments about events

## Related Work

What similar apps and websites? How will your project stand out from these other websites?

Two of the most popular websites for finding an event are ticketmaster and eventbrite. Our project aims to standout by combining these two, and making one website for users to choose from a wide variety of events, that do not have strong limitations. One issue with eventbrite is that they currently do not have a great user interface, and this makes it difficult to narrow down their preferences as the feed is not very organized. Ticketmaster often makes it difficult for users to know about the availability of tickets, and so our project will let users know how many seats, tickets, or spots there are. We also want users to know the likelihood they are able to attend an event based on popularity and pricing.

## Open Questions

What questions do you still have? What topics do you need to research more for your project?

- How would we go about using more than one API? 
- How would we filter events based on a user's interests?
- How would we encrypt personal information of users?
