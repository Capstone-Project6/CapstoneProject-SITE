## User Personas

**Eventgoers**

Sydney is an eventgoer from Atlanta, Georgia that enjoys going to concerts from huge, well known artists to hidden ones. She enjoys going out on the weekends with friends by looking for something to do such as events. She has a full time internship and a limited budget that she can't look for events for a long time and she does not want to spend too much. She is to use the event finder app to look for a concert of any type near her area with specific filters of concerts that cost a certain amount that fits her budget.

Abbey is a 30 year old computer science professional that wants to expand his professional network and learn different coding languages. He wants to keep up with the newer technology to stay competitive with his peers. He will use the app to search for computer science talks, workshops, or webinars to learn the new skills and connect with fellow peers interested in that area. He would be able to filter on which organizers are the best for hosting these type of events.

**Event Organizers**

Sharon enjoys partying and meeting new people frequently to develop friendships of all kinds. She noticed that there are not much events around her area to meet with people. So, she decides to use the app to create an event to party and bring people from her area together. She also wants to let guests know that the event is free to join and to rate her as a great organizer to develop a reputation as a trustworthy organizer. 

Jake's mother passed away from breast cancer. To honor her, he wants to host a walkathon to fundraise money for research towards breat cancer as well as raising awareness to his community. He doesn't know too many people that have dealt with this situation so he creates an event for his county to reach out and connect with those who went through it.
