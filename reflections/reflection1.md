## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

We were able to successfully connect the frontend and backend to view our progress locally on our computers. We did this by pulling down each others code from github, and using it to build off one another. We also were able to register and login a user into our site, as well as ensure that they are authenticated.
 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 One major challenge we faced this week was finding out the main GET request we wanted to use from our API had been deprecated, which meant we were unable to use it. This served as a setback as we have to move forward without an API, and will continute to build the website from scratch.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Yes we were able to finish all of our tasks for the week which were completing the registration and login on both the frontend and backend, authenticating users, creating the endpoints, and building the schema. However, we were able to complete our tasks as our last one required using the API that we are no longer moving forward with.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 The previous labs and assignments helped prepare us in planning and executing our capstone project, specifically Jeff's rate-my-setup video from week 3, as well as the Life-Tracker and Student-Store assignments. When building the frontend, material-ui was very helpful in our design and implementation, and so the documentation was a key resource for us. Also, the mentors were a very helpful resource as they were always there to guide us in the right direction and to answer any questions we had.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 One feature that we would consider "at risk" is the addition of an event-organizer profile. We are currently working on the event-goer profile, and it is our primary focus at the moment. Because we are planning on implementing the event-organizer profile as one of the last features, we do not know if we'll be too preoccupied with other components to complete the event-organizer profile on time.
