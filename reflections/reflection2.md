## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 This week we were able to get the events from our database to display on the page, and successfully connected our database. We also were able to implement a search bar for all of our stored events that is fully functional. We have also added a basic user profile in the front end, as well as an interests page.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Some challenges our group faced this week was to get the database connected to the frontend, and getting events to display on the page. We also struggled with styling in material ui, and learning how to use it. Also, we ran into a few problems with github and trying to push and pull.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We managed to finish all of our tasks in the sprint plan for the week, but initially we overplanned and set an unrealistic goal for ourselves. After revising our sprint plan, we were able to complete all of our required tasks, and were able to deliver an MVP.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 The resourced provided to us helped prepare us in planning and executing our capstone project sprint this week. Specifically, Jeff's videos and github repositories on the rate-my-setup website, and the student-store assignment. In addition to these resources our Workday mentors were very helpful as well as our codepath instructors. 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 At the moment we do not have any features or user stories that seem to be at risk. However, if something unexpected comes up, we will be sure to adapt and to adjust our approach.
