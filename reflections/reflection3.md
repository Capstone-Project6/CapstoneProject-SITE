## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 This week we were able to complete the backend for storing a user's interests, and getting a user's recommended events. We also were able to successfully complete the user profile for a user when they are logged in.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Some challenges we faced were more focused in the backend, and trying to store and access a user's favorite categories, and using that to retrieve their recommended events. Another challenge was formatting the create-events page, and trying to make it look organized.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We were not able to finish all of our tasks in the sprint plan for the week, althought we came very close. We think this may have happened because we overplanned, and set a high standard for what needed to be done by the end of the week. Despite this, we are still satisfied with where we are at the moment.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 The resources provided to us did help prepare us for planning and executing our capstone project this week. Specifically, the instructors helped us debug and solve problems whenever we got stuck. We did not really reference any other provided resources, as we encountered new material that required external research.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

At the moment we do not have any features or user stories that seem to be at risk. However, if something unexpected comes up, we will be sure to adapt and to adjust our approach.
