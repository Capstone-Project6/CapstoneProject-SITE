## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 This week we were able to complete the recommended events, and were able to get them to display on the page. We also were able to successfully update a users profile.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Some challenges our group faced this week was dealing with the backend for the recommended events feature, as well as deploying to heroku.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We were not able to finish all of our tasks in the sprint plan for the week, but we were able to make progress in all of our goals and to complete some core features. Some factors that contributed to this were many events and activities that took up time for the week, and slightly slowed down our progress.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 The resources that helped us prepare in planning and executing our capstone project sprint for the week were our Workday mentors, Codepath instructors, as well as the Student Store assignment.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 Right now the feature that is at risk is the event-organizer page, and if this remains at risk we will change our website to give any user the option to create an event.
